 Subtask 2: Design a Mental Health Awareness Evaluation Plan
 Purpose
This evaluation plan outlines how the effectiveness of a mental health awareness campaign will be measured using psychological tools, ensuring that the outcomes such as increased knowledge, reduced stigma, and behavioral changes are assessed methodically and ethically.

 Step 1: Define Evaluation Objectives
The evaluation aims to measure:

Increase in mental health knowledge
→ Understanding symptoms, causes, and treatments of common mental disorders.

Reduction in stigma
→ Change in attitudes toward individuals with mental health conditions.

Willingness to seek help
→ Openness to using counseling or professional resources.

Behavioral change
→ Increased discussion or sharing of mental health resources with others.

 Step 2: Select Assessment Methods
Quantitative Methods:

Pre- and post-awareness surveys (Likert scale + multiple choice)

Behavioral tracking (e.g., attendance, sign-ups for counseling, social media engagement)

Qualitative Methods:

Focus group feedback (post-campaign)

Optional self-reflection journals from participants

Advanced Method (optional):

Implicit Association Test (IAT) for hidden bias tracking (for select participants)

 Step 3: Timeline for Data Collection
Evaluation Phase	Timeline	Purpose
Pre-Campaign	1 week before campaign launch	Establish baseline awareness
Post-Campaign	1-3 days after campaign ends	Measure immediate impact
Follow-Up Evaluation	1 month after campaign	Evaluate knowledge/behavior retention

Participant Recruitment:

Voluntary sign-up forms (online or during sessions)

Informed consent and confidentiality notice included

 Step 4: Data Analysis Strategy
Quantitative Analysis:

Score average knowledge/attitude responses (pre vs. post)

Track % improvement in survey scores

Monitor engagement data (e.g., number of resources shared or events attended)

Qualitative Analysis:

Thematic coding of focus group feedback and journals

Identify recurring themes like increased openness or emotional relief

Presentation of Results:

Bar/line graphs for knowledge improvement

Pie charts for attitude distributions

Narrative summaries for open-ended responses

 Step 5: Documentation & Ethical Considerations
Confidentiality & Ethics:

All responses collected anonymously or with opt-in consent

Participants can withdraw at any time

Mental health support resources shared with all participants

Documentation Plan:

One evaluation report to include:

Summary of objectives

Description of tools and timeline

Tables and graphs of results

Participant quotes (anonymized)

Recommendations for future programs

 Final Deliverables
A documented evaluation plan (PDF or digital doc)

Checklist of data collection tools (surveys, focus guide, reflection journal)

Visuals/graphs of campaign impact

Recommendations based on data interpretation
