 Subtask 3: Submission & Checklist
This subtask finalizes the deliverables of your Mental Health Awareness Evaluation Project. It includes a complete evaluation plan, survey tools, a data analysis guide, and a refinement strategy to ensure both impact and sustainability.

 Submission Requirements
 1. Structured Mental Health Awareness Evaluation Plan
Your evaluation plan must clearly outline the following:

 Evaluation Objectives
Define 3–5 key goals such as increasing knowledge, reducing stigma, and encouraging help-seeking behavior.

 Assessment Methods
List the tools to be used such as:

Pre- and post-campaign surveys

Focus groups/interviews

Behavioral tracking (attendance, counseling requests)

Optional Implicit Association Test (IAT)

 Timeframe for Evaluation
Define when and how often data will be collected:

Pre-campaign (baseline)

Post-campaign (short-term impact)

Follow-up (long-term impact)

 Data Collection Strategy
Explain how you will collect responses:

Google Forms or similar tools for surveys

In-person or virtual group discussions

Journaling for qualitative reflections

 Data Analysis Methods

Compare pre- and post-data to track change

Use scoring rubrics for survey items

Thematic coding for qualitative responses

Visualizations: bar graphs, pie charts, summary tables

 Ethical Considerations

Ensure anonymity/confidentiality

Obtain informed consent

Provide mental health support resources

 2. Pre- and Post-Survey Questionnaires
Each stage should have at least five questions assessing:

Knowledge

"What are common symptoms of anxiety?"

"What is the role of a counselor in mental health care?"

Attitudes

"How comfortable are you discussing mental health?"

"Do you think mental illness is a sign of personal weakness?"

Behaviors

"Would you seek professional help if experiencing emotional distress?"

"Have you ever talked to someone about mental health?"

All questions should use a mix of multiple-choice, Likert scales, and open-ended formats.

 3. Data Analysis & Interpretation Plan
Create a brief summary explaining how the data will be processed:

Score Likert-scale responses (1–5) and compare average results

Graphs:

Pre vs. Post Knowledge Levels

Stigma Reduction Trends

Behavior Change Metrics

Interpret shifts and highlight trends

Discuss limitations (bias, sample size)

Use findings to identify what worked and what didn’t

 4. Feedback & Refinement Plan
Include a plan for improving the campaign based on participant input:

Post-Campaign Feedback Form

Ask: "What part of the campaign did you find most impactful?"

"How could this campaign be improved?"
