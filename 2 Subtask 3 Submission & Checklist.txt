 1. Summary Document: The Role of Non-Verbal Communication in Mental Health Advocacy
Non-verbal communication—including facial expressions, body posture, tone of voice, and gestures—is critical in shaping how mental health messages are received. Often, people trust these non-verbal cues more than the actual words spoken. In mental health contexts, where trust and empathy are essential, non-verbal signals can either build rapport or create barriers.

 Key Elements:
Body Language: An open stance, relaxed shoulders, and uncrossed arms signal availability and warmth. In contrast, closed or defensive postures may imply discomfort or disinterest.

Facial Expressions: Genuine concern, attentiveness, and compassion should be visible. A mismatch between spoken message and facial expression can reduce credibility.

Tone of Voice: A calm, steady, and warm tone enhances clarity and emotional connection. Monotone or rushed speech can seem impersonal or anxious.

Gestures: Natural, purposeful gestures support message clarity and express confidence. Overuse or stiff movements may distract or confuse listeners.

 Impression Management:
Impression management refers to how advocates consciously shape their public image through non-verbal behavior. Mental health advocates must balance professionalism with empathy, ensuring their appearance, tone, and behavior reinforce trust, credibility, and sincerity. This directly affects how audiences engage with and internalize mental health messages.

 2. Analysis of Two Real-Life Mental Health Talks (TEDx Examples)
 Effective Example: TEDx Talk by Guy Winch – “Why We All Need to Practice Emotional First Aid”
Posture: Upright, open stance.

Eye Contact: Regular, direct engagement with audience.

Tone: Warm, clear, and paced with natural modulation.

Gestures: Controlled hand movements to emphasize key points.

Impact: The speaker appears approachable, informed, and emotionally invested. This builds trust and audience connection.

 Ineffective Example: A less engaging local awareness video (anonymous for respect)
Posture: Slouched and seated with arms crossed.

Eye Contact: Rare, often looking down or away from the camera.

Tone: Flat, rushed, with minimal inflection.

Gestures: Minimal, stiff hand movements; fidgeting visible.

Impact: The speaker appears uncomfortable and unprepared, which can cause viewers to disengage or question the sincerity of the message.

 3. Self-Evaluation Reflection (Approx. 200 Words)
I recorded a 1-minute speech on the importance of normalizing conversations about anxiety.

Strengths:

I maintained good posture with relaxed shoulders and faced the camera directly.

My facial expressions matched the message—I smiled gently when encouraging openness and showed concern when discussing challenges.

My tone was steady, warm, and varied enough to keep attention.

I used light hand gestures to support my points without distracting from the message.

Areas to Improve:

In the beginning, I spoke slightly too fast due to nervousness. I need to pause more between key points.

My hands were occasionally not visible in the frame, which limited expressiveness.

There were moments when my eyes flickered off-camera, making it feel less connected.

Going forward, I plan to slow down, keep gestures in-frame, and maintain more consistent eye contact. Practicing with feedback will help me further improve clarity and emotional impact.
