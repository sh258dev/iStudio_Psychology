 Subtask 1: Explore Psychological Methods for Measuring Awareness Impact
 Summary of Psychological Methods
Understanding the effectiveness of a mental health awareness campaign requires a well-structured evaluation using psychological tools. These methods assess knowledge gain, attitude shifts, and behavioral change.

Key Methods Include:

 Pre- and Post-Assessment Surveys

Measure changes in awareness and attitudes before and after the campaign.

 Implicit Association Tests (IAT)

Capture subconscious biases toward mental health through timed word/image responses.

 Qualitative Interviews & Focus Groups

Collect deeper insights on personal perceptions and emotional impact.

 Behavioral Tracking & Engagement Metrics

Track help-seeking actions, social media shares, and event participation.

 Self-Reflection Journals

Encourage participants to record personal growth and mindset changes.

 Longitudinal Follow-Ups

Evaluate long-term retention of information and sustained behavior changes.
